 *  An `ERC20` compatible Token that conforms to Delaware State Senate,

 *  of the Delaware Code Relating to the General Corporation Law.
 *
 *  Implementation Details.
 *
 *  An implementation of this Token standard SHOULD provide the following:
 *
 *  `name` - for use by wallets and exchanges.
 *  `symbol` - for use by wallets and exchanges.
 *
 *  The implementation MUST take care not to allow unauthorised access to stock
 *  transfer functions.
 *
 *  In addition to the above the following optional `ERC20` function MUST be defined.
 *
 *  `decimals` â€” MUST return `0` as each Token represents a single Share and Shares are non-divisible.
